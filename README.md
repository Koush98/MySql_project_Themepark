## Introduction
The ThemePark SQL Project is designed to demonstrate database management skills with SQL. It includes creating a database schema for a fictional theme park, populating it with sample data, and performing various queries to extract meaningful insights.

## Files Included

create_themepark.sql: SQL script to create the database schema for the theme park.
insert_data.sql: SQL script to populate the database tables with sample data.
queries.sql: SQL script containing a variety of queries to analyze and retrieve data from the theme park database.
README.md: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.

## Database Schema

The database schema includes tables such as themepark, attraction, employee, ticket, sales, sales_line, and hours. Each table captures specific information about theme park details, attractions, employees, ticket sales, and work hours.

## Setup Instructions

To set up the theme park database locally or on a server:

1. Clone the Repository:
[Project Repository]git clone <repository-url>
cd themepark-sql-project

2. Create the Database:
   Execute create_themepark.sql to create the database schema
   mysql -u username -p < create_themepark.sql
3. Insert Sample Data:
   Populate the database with sample data using insert_data.sql
   mysql -u username -p < insert_data.sql
4. Run Queries:
mysql -u username -p < queries.sql

## Queries and Analysis
The queries.sql file contains SQL queries to:
 Retrieve information about theme park attractions and ticket sales.
Calculate total revenue generated from ticket sales.
Analyze employee work hours and their contributions to sales.
Identify popular attractions based on visitor counts.

## Deployment
This project can be deployed to any MySQL-compatible database server. Follow the setup instructions to initialize the database schema and populate it with data.
